"use strict";// this means treat all js code as newer versions

//    alert(3+3); // we are using nodejs not browser engine

// it is good to give semicolon

// code readibility is good practice and should be high

// DataTypes
let name = 'hitesh';//string
let age = 23;// number
let isLoggedIn = true;//boolean
//number
//bigint
//string
//boolean
//null=>standalone value -- for ex if we define let age; this is undefined as its value is not defined but for null we need to use let age= null; this can be used somewhere like we need to get temperature but 0 is real value then we get null , null means khali
//undefined => when value is not defined,not assigned
//symbol => uniqueness
//object=> veryImp

console.log(typeof age) // got number
console.log(typeof undefined) //got undefined
console.log(typeof null) // got object
