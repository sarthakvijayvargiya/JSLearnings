<!--Fetch API is developed in recent days around 4-5 years - but, Before that XMLHttpRequest is used for fetching API -->

<!-- Understanding APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) involves familiarizing yourself with several basic terms. Here's a list of key terms that can help you better grasp the concepts related to APIs:

API (Application Programming Interface):
An interface that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

Request:
When a client (e.g., a web browser or another application) asks the API for information, it sends a request. This request can be in various formats such as HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

Response:
The data sent back by the API after processing a request. It can be in different formats such as JSON, XML, or others, depending on the API's design.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
The protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. APIs often use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform different actions.

REST (Representational State Transfer):
An architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
RESTful APIs provide a standardized way for different systems to communicate over the internet, promoting simplicity, scalability, and modifiability.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):
A lightweight data-interchange format commonly used for data exchange between a server and a client in a web application. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

XML (Extensible Markup Language):
Another format for representing structured data. While less common in modern APIs, some still use XML for data exchange.

Authentication:
The process of verifying the identity of a user, application, or system. APIs often require authentication to control access and ensure security.

Token:
A piece of data used in authentication, typically provided by an authentication server. Tokens are often included in API requests to verify the identity of the requester.

Rate Limiting:
A mechanism used by APIs to control the number of requests a client can make within a specified time frame. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage.

SDK (Software Development Kit):
A set of tools, libraries, and documentation that helps developers interact with and use a particular software platform or API.

Documentation:
Detailed information about how to use an API, including endpoints, request and response formats, authentication methods, and examples. Good documentation is crucial for developers using an API.
Understanding these terms provides a foundation for working with APIs and integrating them into your applications. -->

<!-- Console log -->
<!-- console is not originally a part of javascript , jese document of window bhi core JS ka part nhi h, core JS m bs basic operation loops function y hota h, baki y jo bhi h vo excessive api's h -->
<!-- Jese conlose log ek debuggur tool h apki api ka ,browser ka dev toll -JS ka run time inject krta h-->


<!-- v8 available in github - V8 engine provides these debugging tool , api access to work -->
